This plugin causes all trailing whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) to be highlighted.
Whitespace for the current line will not be highlighted while in insert mode. 
It is possible to disable current line highlighting while in other modes as well.
A helper function ':StripWhitespace' is also provided to make whitespace cleaning painless.
